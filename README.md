This project focuses on performing named entity recognition (NER) on comments written by users in Reddit for GPT. The goal is to extract entities such as person names, organizations, locations, and other relevant information from the comments. The project compares the performance of three different libraries for NER: spaCy, NLTK, and Flair.

## Project Overview

Named entity recognition is an important task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves identifying and classifying named entities in text. In this project, we aim to analyze comments from Reddit and extract entities using different NER libraries.

The project consists of the following components:

1. NER Libraries:
    - spaCy: Utilize the spaCy library for NER. It provides pre-trained models and a straightforward API for entity recognition.
    - NLTK: Use the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library, which offers various NER techniques and models.
    - Flair: Employ the Flair library, which combines contextualized word embeddings with state-of-the-art NER models.

2. Entity Extraction: Apply the chosen NER libraries to extract named entities from the Reddit comments. Evaluate the performance of each library in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score.

3. Result Comparison: Compare the results obtained from each library and analyze their performance. Identify the strengths and weaknesses of each library in the context of Reddit comment NER.

4. Visualization: Generate plots or visualizations to showcase the distribution of different entities found in the comments. Compare the entity recognition performance across libraries.
